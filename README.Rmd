An R data package containing tidy formatted summary data on vehicle trends in the United States. The primary data source is vehicle listings from [marketcheck.com](https://www.marketcheck.com/), which have been processed into summary statistics including depreciation curves, mileage accumulation, market concentration, and market share breakdowns.

For a live dashboard of the data, visit [vehicletrends.us](https://vehicletrends.us).

## Installation

You can install vehicletrends from GitHub:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("vehicletrends/vehicletrends")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(vehicletrends)
```

Once loaded, all datasets are available directly by name. See the [package documentation site](https://pkg.vehicletrends.us/) for details on each dataset.

## Datasets

### `depreciation`

Retention rate (price / MSRP) quantiles for used vehicles by age, powertrain, and vehicle type. A retention rate of 1.0 means 100% value retention; 0.5 means 50% value loss. Quantiles (25th, 50th, 75th) are provided at 3-month age intervals up to 15 years.

```{r}
head(depreciation)
```

### `registrations`

Annual light-duty vehicle registration counts by US state and powertrain type, sourced from the [Alternative Fuels Data Center](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicle-registration) for years 2016--2024.

```{r}
head(registrations)
```

### `vmt_age`

Cumulative odometer mileage quantiles (25th, 50th, 75th) for used vehicles at 3-month age intervals up to 15 years, broken out by powertrain and vehicle type.

```{r}
head(vmt_age)
```

### `vmt_daily`

Daily vehicle miles traveled (odometer miles / vehicle age in days) quantiles from the 1st through 99th percentile, by powertrain and vehicle type.

```{r}
head(vmt_daily)
```

### `vmt_annual_type`

Estimated annual VMT for each combination of powertrain and vehicle type, derived from OLS regressions of odometer miles on vehicle age.

```{r}
head(vmt_annual_type)
```

### `vmt_annual_model`

Estimated annual VMT for individual make/model combinations (minimum 100 listings), derived from OLS regressions of odometer miles on vehicle age.

```{r}
head(vmt_annual_model)
```
