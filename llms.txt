# vehicletrends

An R data package containing tidy formatted summary data on vehicle
trends in the United States. The primary data source is vehicle listings
from [marketcheck.com](https://www.marketcheck.com/), which have been
processed into summary statistics including depreciation curves, mileage
accumulation, market concentration, and market share breakdowns.

For a live dashboard of the data, visit
[vehicletrends.us](https://vehicletrends.us).

## Installation

You can install vehicletrends from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
