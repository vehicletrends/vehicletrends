\description{
Estimated annual vehicle miles traveled for individual vehicle make/model
combinations. Computed by fitting OLS regressions of total odometer miles on
vehicle age (in years) for used vehicle listings; the slope coefficient
represents the estimated annual VMT. Only make/model combinations with at
least 100 listings are included, and results are filtered to positive annual
VMT values only.
