\description{
Summary statistics of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) across US census
tracts, measuring market concentration for different vehicle market
dimensions. HHI values are computed per census tract based on dealers
reachable within a 60-minute drive time isochrone, then summarized across
tracts. Higher HHI values indicate greater market concentration (less
diversity). Nine grouping-variable combinations are included: for each
grouping variable (powertrain, vehicle type, price bin), HHI is computed
over the other three variables (make, and the two remaining grouping
variables).
