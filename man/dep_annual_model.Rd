\description{
Estimated annual depreciation rate for individual vehicle make/model
combinations. Computed by fitting log-linear regressions of retention
rate (price / MSRP) on vehicle age (in years) for used vehicle listings;
the annual depreciation rate is \code{1 - exp(b)} where \code{b} is the
age coefficient. Only used vehicles aged 1--10 years with valid price and
MSRP values are included. Only make/model combinations with at least 100
listings are included, and results are filtered to positive depreciation
rates only.
